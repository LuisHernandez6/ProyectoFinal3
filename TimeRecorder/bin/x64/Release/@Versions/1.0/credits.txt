DottierGalaxy50 - Program in general.

I don't have much experience coding, because of that i wouldn't have been able to finish this program if it wasn't because of the help of many people yt
tutorials and posts with problem solutions and code that i was able to use and learn from.

 --------------------------------------------------------

Some people yt channels that teached me how to do certain things and introduced me to wpf where:

This doesn't include everything of course, has it would have been too time consuming for me to look every page i went to, but overall, thanks to people on
forums like stackoverflow for teaching c#, xaml, etc... and giving code solutions in general.
